# CardGame
School programming project used to practice object oriented programming and graphical user interface design.  Basic computer AI is implemented as an opponent in the card game.  
Players start with a hand of 4 cards and each player starts their turn by drawing a card from either the deck or the discard pile.  Each player ends their turn by picking which 5th card to place into the discard pile.  The discard pile starts empty and the user always goes first.  Discard pile is reshuffled into the deck when the card deck is depleted.
The first player to obtain a hand of 4 cards of the same type is the winner.
